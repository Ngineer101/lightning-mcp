# Product Requirements Document

## Overview
**Product Name:** lightning-mcp

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**

Currently, the MCP server is generated using text templates and handlebars. This is not future proof since the MCP APIs are subject to change and the generated code will not be updated. To solve this, an MCP server should be generated by an LLM of the user's choice using the latest MCP docs found here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt. The LLM should read this doc and generate the server based on the latest MCP docs and the user's choice of LLM.

## Solution
**What are we building?**

Build a CLI tool that generates an MCP server from a Swagger/OpenAPI document using an LLM of the user's choice. For a start, add support for Claude 3.5 and Claude 3.5 sonnet, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash.

## Technical Requirements
**Must Have:**
- A CLI tool that generates an MCP server from a Swagger/OpenAPI document using an LLM of the user's choice

**Nice to Have:**
- Support for multiple LLMs
- Support for different LLM providers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
